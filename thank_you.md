# Acknowledgements

## I would like to give a big thanks to Robert Nystrom. [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
Before starting this project the majority of my experience with coding had been in Java and JS. I had dabbled in C through some simple, happy-path programming. However, I had no experience with C macros and little experience with the minutiae of pointers. 

There were many segfaults along the way. I bought the book Crafting Interpreters on Kindle, and I very much enjoyed the book. (The majority of the code is based on what's provided for a Lox compiler.) Programming can be a dry subject matter and all of the anecdotes and asides were fun to read or think about.

When I started, I took on the challenge as I normally enjoy learning something new in coding. I applied my own naming conventions and tried to do some functions slightly differently. To really see if I have an understanding of the core concepts. This was a bigger challenge than I had anticipated, the Java section of the book was smooth sailing. I chose to take a break to invest time in learning more about the C programming language itself. 

Learning how to code is an investment and learning how to write a compiler or interpreter is difficult. There were many parts of this code I would not have been able to do on my own. And I am very thankful for getting to use the experience and expertise provided within the book.

## I would like to thank my friends.
I was encouraged to pursue this project by my friends. I had some ideas on what could make a better programming language, but I don't have much experience outside of Java or JS (two languages). I was recommended "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks" by Bruce Tate.

I got to see my first taste of Ruby. I immediately saw the **unless** keyword and I loved the concept. It's why Mu has (if, unless) and (while, until), if programming languages are supporting (and, or) the same should apply to conditional statements and loops. Allowing the language to feel more human, and allowing the programmer to think more in the moment.
